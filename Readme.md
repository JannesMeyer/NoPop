# NoPop #

Some sites seemed to get around Chrome's builtin popup blocker, so I built this extension.

Unfortunately this extension requires quite broad permissions, but I can't change that as long Chrome doesn't have a real API for popup blocking. This extension does nothing on sites that are encrypted (HTTPS).

## Installation ##

Get the extension from the [Downloads section](https://github.com/JannesMeyer/NoPop/downloads) or from the Chrome Web Store (coming soon).
